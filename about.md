# About

Hi! I'm legoraft, a random guy that loves to mess around with computers and in games. I use this blog to talk about things that are on my mind and projects I'm working on.

If you'd like to take a look at my projects, check out my [github](https://github.com/legoraft). You can also follow this blog through [rss](https://legoraft.com/feed.xml) if that's something you like more.
