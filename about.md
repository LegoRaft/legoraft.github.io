Hi! I'm legoraft, someone who loves messing around with computers and tinkering with all sorts of stuff. I use this blog to write about things that are on my mind and stuff I think is cool. I mostly write about Linux, Minecraft and some programming if I feel like it.

I like being able to write about things, but that doesn't mean the writing is any good. Just enjoy my ramblings and feel free to let me know if you have an opinion on something
