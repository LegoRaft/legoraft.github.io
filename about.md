# About

Hi! I'm legoraft, a random guy that loves to mess around with computers and in games. I use this blog to talk about things that are on my mind and projects I'm working on. I love to mess around in linux and I play a lot of Minecraft (and sometimes some other games).

If you'd like to take a look at my projects, check out my [github](https://github.com/legoraft). If you like to use an rss reader to follow this blog, feel free to do so. You can download it [here](https://legoraft.com/feed.xml).
